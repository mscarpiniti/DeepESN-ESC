# DeepESN-ESC
A deep version of Echo State Network (DeepESN) for Environmental Sound Classification (ESC) with specific application to construction sites.

A DeepESN consists in the cascade of several reservoirs whose hidden states are concatenated in a unique and high-representative state vector used as input to a consecutive classifier, selected among several ones (i.e., linear, kNN, MLP, SVM, and random forest).

The proposed model is based on the TensorFlow implementation of the Deep Reservoir Computing introduced by [Claudio Gallicchio](https://github.com/gallicch/DeepRC-TF) in:
